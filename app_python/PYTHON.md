## Framework: Flask

### Why Flask?
Flask is the best choice for this webapp because:
1. **Lightweight and Minimalistic**: Flask is a micro-framework, so it is suitable for small apps like this one.
2. **Easy to Use**: It's beginner-friendly and provides good documentation.
3. **Flexibility**: Flask allows to add only the required components without unnecessary ones.

### Alternative Consideration
Another potential framework was Django, which provides more features, 
but it is more complex and often used for bigger applications.
